## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean **separation of concerns**:

- **State (`state.js`)**
  - Manages expenses and budget
  - Handles persistence via localStorage
  - Provides filtering & aggregation logic

- **UI (`ui.js`)**
  - Renders expense list, dashboard & charts
  - Manages theme, toasts, and form states

- **App (`app.js`)**
  - Acts as the controller
  - Connects UI actions with state updates
  - Coordinates rendering and data flow

This structure keeps the codebase readable, scalable, and interview-friendly.
